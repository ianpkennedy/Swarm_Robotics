''' Function to initialize agent's poses. 
Input:
    swarmsize --  swarmsize.
    x -- An array to store  agents' x positions, the length of this array is the same as swarmsize
    y -- An array to store agents' y positions, the length of this array is the same as swarmsize
    theta -- An array to store agents' orientations, the length of this is the same as swarmsize

Usage:
    Usr can configure an agent's initial x, y, theta by modifying the value of the corresponding element in array x, y, and theta. 
    For example, initialize agent 0's pose to x = 0, y = 1, theta = 2:
    x[0] = 0
    y[0] = 1
    theta[0] = 2

Constraints to be considered:
    x -- the value should range between -2.5 to 2.5.
    y -- the value should range between -1.5 to 1.5.
    theta -- the value should range between -pi to pi.
    
    The minimal pairwise inter-agent distance should be greater than 0.12
